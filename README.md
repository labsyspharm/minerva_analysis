# Gater | Minerva Analysis

![](minerva_analysis/gater/src/img/logo_with_text.svg)

## About
This is  an [openseadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) based **Cellular Image Viewing and Analysis Tool**. 
It is built with a python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) backend and a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) javascript frontend.

## Executables (for Users)
Releases can be found here:
https://github.com/labsyspharm/minerva_analysis/releases
These are executables for Windows and MacOS that can be run locally without any installations.


## Running as a Docker container

* Build image: `docker build -t gating .` 
* Run image with mounted path: `docker run --rm -dp 8000:8000 -v [source path]:/[target path] gating`

where
* `--rm` cleans up the container after it finishes executing
* `-v` mounts the "present working directory" (containing your data) to be `/data` inside the container. This is necessary in order to import your data via the import page.
* `-dp` forwards the port 8000

Once the container is running, go to `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser. 
To import your imaging files in the import gui type in the mounted `/data/..`

## Packaging/Bundling Code as Executable (for Developers)
Any tagged commit to a branch will trigger a build, where `tag == commit message`. This will appear under releases. Note building may take ~10 min.

Tagging Conventions: All release tags should look like `v{version_number}_{branch_name}`.
