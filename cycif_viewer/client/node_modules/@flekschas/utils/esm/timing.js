/**
 * Throttle and debounce a function call

 * Throttling a function call means that the function is called at most every
 * `interval` milliseconds no matter how frequently you trigger a call.
 * Debouncing a function call means that the function is called the earliest
 * after `finalWait` milliseconds wait time where the function was not called.
 * Combining the two ensures that the function is called at most every
 * `interval` milliseconds and is ensured to be called with the very latest
 * arguments after after `finalWait` milliseconds wait time at the end.
 *
 * The following imaginary scenario describes the behavior:
 *
 * MS | throttleTime=3 and debounceTime=3
 * 1. y(f, 3, 3)(args1) => f(args1) called
 * 2. y(f, 3, 3)(args2) => call ignored due to throttling
 * 3. y(f, 3, 3)(args3) => call ignored due to throttling
 * 4. y(f, 3, 3)(args4) => f(args4) called
 * 5. y(f, 3, 3)(args5) => all ignored due to throttling
 * 6. No call           => nothing
 * 7. No call           => f(args5) called due to debouncing
 *
 * @param {functon} func - Function to be throttled and debounced
 * @param {number} interval - Throttle intevals in milliseconds
 * @param {number} wait - Debounce wait time in milliseconds By default this is
 *   the same as `interval`.
